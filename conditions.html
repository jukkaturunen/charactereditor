Whenever circumstances become too similar to the situation that led to you gaining this Condition, the player rolls Resolve + Composure.

How your character responds to this is up to you, but it captivates her and eats her attention. You can shed this Condition when your character's fear and fascination causes her to do something that hinders the group or complicates things (she goes off alone to investigate a strange noise, stays up all night researching, runs away instead of holding her ground, etc.).",
